# React Route Tutorial

This is me following along on the Router tutorial.
For me it is about getting exposed to it so that
i hopefully soon will start to grasp it.
Some make sense, and some dont.
ItÂ´s easy to follow along ofcourse, its another story
to actually understand it all, but i do thankfully
get the filosophy behind Router and why it exists.
